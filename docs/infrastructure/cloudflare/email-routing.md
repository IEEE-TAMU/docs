# Email Routing Worker

We use a Cloudflare Worker to handle email routing. This allows us to provide `ieeetamu.org` email addresses to officers.

- **Repository:** [https://github.com/IEEE-TAMU/email-routing](https://github.com/IEEE-TAMU/email-routing)

This worker intercepts incoming emails and routes them to the appropriate personal email addresses of the officers.
